Python support for [MC-NBFX]: .NET Binary Format: XML Data Structure




## Overview 

This library provides a comprehensive solution for converting XML documents to NBFX and vice versa. By using Python's built-in XML AST structure `ElementTree` as its internal representation, it provides an efficient and clean method of interacting with NBFX data.

### Parsing

The concept of monadic parser combinators is used heavily in the parsing and serialization library.  Even though python is not exactly a functional language, these concepts provide a stable and easy to debug method of parser construction.

This version has little to no backtracking.
